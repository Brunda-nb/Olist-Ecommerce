Olist is a Brazilian departmental store (marketplace) that operates in e-commerce segment, but is not an e-commerce itself (as she says). It operates as a **SaaS (Software as a Service) technology company since 2015.** It offers a marketplace solution (of e-commerce segment) to shopkeepers of all sizes (and for most segments) to increase their sales whether they have online presence or not.

##  **Olist’s Solution**
Olist’s solution consists of three aspects: Software, Contracts with the main marketplaces and Reputation sharing. The diagram below shows how Olist links marketplaces, consumers (Portuguese: consumidores), and retailers (Portuguese: varejistas)

## **What Olist says?**
Olist says she…

- … is a large department store within marketplaces.
- … is connected to the main **e-commerces of Brazil**.
- … does not buy products.
- … does not keep products in stock.
- … does not carry out shipping of any products offered in its store.
- All products are sold and shipped by the thousands of shopkeepers (registered on Olist*) who sell through Olist.
- Her strength lies in union of all participating shopkeepers, who are selling physical products.
- Participant shopkeeper is responsible for separating, packing, and taking products to the logistics operator.
Please note Olist’s perspective (**a supply chain preview**): she prescribes there are many factors that can influence the sales of a shopkeeper e.g. type of product, demand, seasonality, competitive pricing, terms, inventory etc

In image below Olist describes (in Portuguese) how it differentiates itself from the other marketplaces based on reputation, product placements, dedicated teams to sales & customer service, reduced time to start selling, centralised control of operations and other competitive tools.

## **Data Model**
On Kaggle, she shared its data of **100k** orders from **2016 to 2018**. There are **8+1 datasets** to play with and explore. The data model has been described in image below and it is organised and normalised for each category.
